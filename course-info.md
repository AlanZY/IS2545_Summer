**Class GitHub repo:** https://www.github.com/LaboonCourses/CS1632_summer

**Required Text:** _A Friendly Introduction to Software Testing_ by Bill Laboon.
* This is a PDF and is available on Github
  * https://github.com/laboon/software-testing/blob/master/software-testing-laboon-ebook.pdf
  * If you spot a typo or mistake, or suggest an improvement that I use, and file it as a pull request or issue on the source repository (ebook), you can get 0.5 extra percentage point (out of 100), up to 2 percentage points.
  * In other words, if you finish the semester with a 90, but submitted 4 valid issues / typo fixes / whatever, your final grade is 90 + 2, 92.
* If you like, you may purchase a physical copy on Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Introduction-Software-Testing/dp/1523477377/ or CreateSpace at: https://www.createspace.com/6008739 .  It is $14.95 at either.
  * However, this is NOT NECESSARY.  All material is available online, either in this repository or in the (freely available) PDF version of the book linked above.  Some people prefer to have a physical copy and I have made this book as affordable as I can for those who prefer that.

This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual and automated tests, test-driven and behavior-driven development, performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing process.

## Grading

This class will be graded entirely on projects and in-class exercises.  There will be no tests.  Attendance during in-class exercises is necessary for a grade, except under extraordinary circumstances.

Note that I do *not* accept late projects, except for medical or other emergencies.  It is your responsibility to turn projects in on time.

Grading:
  * Deliverable 1 (Manual test planning) - 15%
  * Deliverable 2 (Unit tests / TDD) - 15%
  * Deliverable 3 (System testing) - 15%
  * Deliverable 4 (Performance Testing) - 10%
  * Deliverable 5 (Combinatorial Testing)- 10%
  * Deliverable 6 (Testing Process) - 20%
* Class Exercises - 15%

Total: The grading scale below shall be used. Note that I do not round grades up (or down), although I may curve the course grades for the entire class.  This will _only_ be done if the curve favors students (that is, I may make a 93.00 the new lower bound for an A; I will never increase the lower bound to, say, 96.00)

100.00-94.00 A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93.99-91.00	 A-
90.99-88.00	 B+
87.99-84.00	 B
83.99-81.00	 B-
80.99-78.00	 C+
77.99-74.00	 C
73.99-71.00	 C-
70.99-68.00	 D+
67.99-64.00	 D
63.99-61.00	 D-
60.99-0.00	 F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.  However, any student caught collaborating or cheating in an unauthorized way will get an automatic 0 for that assignment, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.  Examples of unauthorized collaboration include: wholesale copying and pasting of large sections of code, asking somebody else to do the assignment for you, or paying somebody to do the assignment for you.  If you question whether what you are doing is authorized, you may feel free to come speak with me during office hours or email me.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub by the beginning of class on the due date.  Write-ups are due at the beginning of class. Late assignments will not be accepted.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.  I will hand back papers and put the grades on CourseWeb in a reasonable amount of time.

****

Attendance for normal lectures is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended.  The instructor will try to ensure that all information will be available via slides or the textbook, but simply reading them may be insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly.

Presence for group exercise days and for visting lectures is required in order to get the full class participation score.  These will not be rescheduled individually.

## Programming Language Selection

For deliverables 1 through 6, the class will use Java with the appropriate frameworks and tools (e.g., JUnit, Mockito, Selenium, VisualVM, Findbugs).  For the final project, students will write a paper on developing a testing process for a system under test, using the knowledge gained from other projects.  The students will then present a short talk summarizing their paper for the class.

If you want to use Java but aren't a fan of Eclipse, information on setting up the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) with the required packages for this course can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/alexlafroscia/c6757de349b27e34eff6).
